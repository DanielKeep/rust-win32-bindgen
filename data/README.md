# `winver.json`

This contains a list of known Windows version identifiers.

There must be *exactly one* primary identifier that maps to a given version number.  All identifiers that begin with an asterisk are considered secondary aliases.

This should cover the `WIN32_WINNT_*` and `NTDDI_*` identifiers.
